## Features

- Add reminders
- Get repetitive notifications for each reminder.
- Mark reminders as "Done" to stop getting repetitive notifications.
- Delete reminders.
- Repeat reminders. This is different from the repetition of notifications, as the reminder is getting repeated, not the notification.
- Title Parsing. Entering "Take a nap in 15 minutes" would automatically parse title "Take a nap" while reminder time would be set as 15 minutes from the time of setting the reminder.
- Archive List

## Features to be implemented

- Quick edit to reminders through notification.
- Improvement in the Title Parsing.
- Routine Reminders. Such as, "Drink Water" every 30 minutes. These wouldn't have repetitive notifications.
