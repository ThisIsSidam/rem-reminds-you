# Rem Reminds You : A Reminder Application

This is a simple reminder app built using Flutter. But it is not so simple as it reminds user repetetively until the reminder gets marked as "Done" or "Silence".

## Features

- Add reminders
- Get repetitive notifications for each reminder.
- Mark reminders as "Done" or "Silence". "Done" deletes a reminder, while "Silence" only stops notifications.
- Delete reminders.
- Repeat reminders. This is different from the repetition of notifications, as the reminder is getting repeated, not the notification.
- Title Parsing. Entering "Take a nap in 15 minutes" would automatically parse title "Take a nap" while reminder time would be set as 15 minutes from the time of setting the reminder.

## Features to be implemented

- Archive List
- Routine Reminders. Such as, "Drink Water" every 30 minutes. These wouldn't have repetitive notifications.

## Getting Started
