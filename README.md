## Features

- Add reminders
- Get repetitive notifications for each reminder.
- Mark reminders as "Done" to stop getting repetitive notifications.
- Delete reminders.
- Repeat reminders. This is different from the repetition of notifications, as the reminder is getting repeated, not the notification.
- Title Parsing. Entering "Take a nap in 15 minutes" would automatically parse title "Take a nap" while reminder time would be set as 15 minutes from the time of setting the reminder.
- Archive List
- Quick Access to reminders through notification.
- Settings Page with options to edit the default values.

## Features to be implemented

- Add swipe actions.
- Improvement in the Title Parsing.
- Routine Reminders. Such as, "Drink Water" every 30 minutes. These wouldn't have repetitive notifications.
- Update Quick Access to Quick Edit. Instead of tapping and moving to the reminder, edit it right in the notification section.
- Sometime reminder. A reminder which would randomly be shown on weekends. Things, that don't have a specific time, but just have to be done.
- Improve the Settings page.
