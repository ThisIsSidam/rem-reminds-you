## Features

- Addition and deletion of reminders.
- Get repetitive notifications for each reminder.
- Recurring reminders.
- Title Parsing. Entering "Take a nap in 15 minutes" would automatically parse title "Take a nap" while reminder time would be set as 15 minutes from the time of setting the reminder.
- Archive List
- Quick Access to reminders through notification.
- Editable default values in reminder sheet.
- Swipe gestures. Like, swipe to mark as done, postpone and more.
- Increment or decrement font size.
- Backup and Restore reminders.

## Features to be implemented

- Routine Reminders. Such as, "Drink Water" every 30 minutes. These wouldn't have repetitive notifications.
- Update Quick Access to Quick Edit. Instead of tapping and moving to the reminder, edit it right in the notification section.
- Sometime reminder. A reminder which would randomly be shown on weekends. Things, that don't have a specific time, but just have to be done.
- Improve the Settings page.
